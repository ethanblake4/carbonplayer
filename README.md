# Carbon Player

Carbon Player is a WIP fully-featured drop-in replacement for the Google Play Music Android app.

## Features
Currently supported features include: 
- Logging in and retrieving your music library (Artists, albums, playlists, and songs so far)
- 2 factor authentication
- Viewing and playing music from the Top Charts, Home, New Releases and Browse Stations pages
- Searching for music and playing from search results
- Viewing, reordering, adding to, and deleting from queue
- Filtering explicit tracks in radios
- Adding/removing tracks and albums to/from library

## Enhancements
Carbon Player is intended to improve upon the original Google Play Music application in a number of ways:
- A greatly improved design, adhering strictly to Material Design principles, with liberal use of beautiful, image-based color palettes and bold animations
- Improved fluidity. On modern devices, Carbon aims for a nearly constant 60fps experience.
- Improved UX (no more accidentally deleting a track from a playlist!)

## Roadmap
There are several things that remain to be added. In loose order of priority, here are the major ones:
- Shuffle and Repeat modes
- Download support and Downloaded Only mode
- Recents page
- Chromecast support
- Google Assistant integration
- Podcasts
- Multiple accounts
